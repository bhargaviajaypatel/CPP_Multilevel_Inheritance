# CPP_Multilevel_Inheritance
In C++, we can not only derive a class from the base class but you can also derive a class from the derived class. This is known as Multilevel Inheritance. 
Multilevel inheritance is similar to retation between grandfather,father and child. The level of inheritance can be extended to any number of level depending upon the relation.
